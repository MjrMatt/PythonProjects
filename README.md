# PythonProjects
My mini-Python Projects

Most of theese were created inspired by a book "Automate The Boring Stuff With Python".

Rename_photos.py was created for purposes of my own and the inspiration was my Love, who needed such a script for organizing our mutual photo collection:)

Catan_Dices.py is a simple script for board game "Settlers of Catan" to pseudorandomization of numbers generated by dices while playing.
